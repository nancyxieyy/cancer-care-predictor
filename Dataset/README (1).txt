Description: Meta data consisting of the clinical and molecular information on colon cancer patient samples. The data has been filtered from the source data to retain only stage II/III colon cancer samples.

Key information to note: The columns highlighted in red are your cancer relapse or survival outcomes. 
rfs_event denotes relapse-free survival event; 0 whether the event (relapse) has not occurred or 1 occurred.
rfs_months denotes the duration until the event (relapse) occurred, in months.
os_event, similar to rfs, but this is overall survival which represent whether the patient died 1, or still alive 0.
os_months, months till the event occurred (death).

Other molecular and pathological information you might be interested is (but not necessary) highlighted in green:
age_at_diagnosis: the age patient were when they first got diagnosed with colon cancer.
sex: sex of the patient
tnm_stage: cancer stage of the patient.
chemotherapy_adjuvant: did the patient receieved chemotherapy after surgery? yes or no
chemotherapy_adjuvant_type: What sort of chemotherapy did the patient recieved?

Highlighted in yellow (some molecular subtyping that our group are interested in, not important for your project perhaps):
CMS: Consensus Molecular Subtypes
PDS: Pathway-derived Subtypes
